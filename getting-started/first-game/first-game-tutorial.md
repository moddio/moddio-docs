**Title:** *Moddio Tutorial | How To Create a Slime Game In 25 Minutes*  
**Description:** In this video, we build a simple **3D Slime Game**. You’ll learn how to:

1. **Import 3D assets** (slime model, etc.) into Modd.io.  
2. **Create a moving player** character that can move or jump around the scene.  
3. **Set up consumable items** (an apple) that randomly spawns in a small area and respawns when eaten.  
4. **Add props to the scene** to make the environment more engaging.  
5. Keep track of and **increase a total score** each time the player consumes the apple.

By the end, you’ll have a working 3D game loop with basic player movement, item spawning, and scoring!

## Next Steps

- Once you’ve followed along, consider checking out the [Game Templates](getting-started/first-game/game-templates.md) page for more ready-made projects.  
- Explore the [Entities Editor](using-scripts/entity-types/entity-types.md) to learn more about customizing your 3D player, items, or other Units.  
- Try adding your own variations—like spawning different item types or awarding bonus points.

Enjoy creating and experimenting with Modd.io!
