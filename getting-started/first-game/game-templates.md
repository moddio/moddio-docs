Game templates allow you to start making your new game, but not completely from scratch. Modd.io currently has 14 game templates, 13 excluding the blank template. Each template has code, art, scripts, and more that make it unique.

Some game templates that are more outdated now have newer versions. These newer versions have "Advanced" in their template name. They have completely custom artwork, and more content than the original templates.
