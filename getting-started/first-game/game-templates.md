## Game Templates

Game templates let you **start building** your new game without having to begin entirely from scratch. Each template comes pre-loaded with **code, art, scripts, and unique logic** that you can immediately customize. Modd.io currently has over 15 game templates—including a **Blank Template** if you prefer a fresh start.

### Using a Template

1. **Open the Create Game Wizard**  
   You’ll see a grid of template cards with **Preview** and **Use Template** buttons.

2. **Preview a Template**  
   Click **Preview** to quickly test-drive the template—no commitment. Get a feel for its gameplay, assets, and mechanics.

3. **Use Template**  
   When you find one you like, click **Use Template** to create a copy. This copy appears in your “My Games,” ready for you to rename, edit, and customize however you like.

### Advanced Versions

Some older templates have updated, more robust “Advanced” counterparts. These advanced templates typically include:

- **Custom artwork** and **up-to-date scripts**
- More features and complex logic
- Polished design and improved performance

If you see both an original and an “Advanced” version of the same template, try the advanced one for a richer starting point.

### Why Use a Template?

- **Faster Start**: Avoid coding every mechanic from the ground up.  
- **Learn by Example**: Examine the built-in scripts, items, and logic.  
- **Easier Customization**: Simply swap out art, tweak behaviors, and add new features.  
- **Upgrades**: The advanced templates are often maintained for new features or best practices.

### Tips for Customizing

1. **Explore the Scripts** to learn how they handle spawning, scoring, or AI.  
2. **Replace Art** with your own or the Modd.io Asset Library to personalize the look.  
3. **Add Entities**: Introduce new Items, Units, or Projectiles for fresh gameplay elements.  
4. **Tweak the Rules**: Adjust damage values, speeds, or spawn frequencies.  
5. **Build On Top**: If you started with an advanced template, you already have a solid foundation to expand.

**In short:** Templates are a fantastic shortcut. **Preview** them to find one that suits your concept, **Use Template** to make it yours, then dive into the editor to modify scripts, art, and gameplay for a fully personalized Modd.io experience.
