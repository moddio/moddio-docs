# Projectile Scripts

In Moddio, **Projectile Scripts** define how projectiles behave and interact with the game world. Much like Items and Units, you can respond to various events such as projectiles **colliding** with walls, units, or other objects. Below, we‚Äôll explore:

1. **Where to attach Projectile scripts**  
2. **Common triggers** you can use  
3. **Examples** of practical scripting scenarios

## Attaching a Script to a Projectile

There are two primary ways to script your Projectiles:

1. **Projectile Script (via Editor)**  
   - In the **Game Editor**, select or create a new **Projectile** type.  
   - Navigate to the **Scripts** (or similarly named) tab, where you can add triggers specific to that projectile.

2. **Global Scripts Affecting Projectiles**  
   - Alternatively, you can create a **Global Script** and use triggers referencing Projectiles (e.g., ‚Äúwhen this entity touches projectile‚Äù).  
   - Ideal if you want a broad rule for **all** projectiles in the game, like applying universal collision logic or damage.

Either method lets you define triggers and actions that handle what happens when your projectile strikes a target, enters a sensor, or expires in flight.

## Triggers for Projectile Scripts

When creating or editing a script, you can filter by typing ‚Äúprojectile‚Äù to find relevant triggers. Here is an example:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img
    src="imgs/projectile1.PNG"
    alt="Searching triggers with 'projectile'"
    style="max-width: 600px; height: auto;"
  />
</div>

> *Example:* You might see triggers such as ‚Äúwhen this entity touches projectile,‚Äù ‚Äúwhen a projectile enters this entity‚Äôs sensor,‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen this entity stops touching projectile.‚Äù

## Common Projectile Triggers & Use Cases

Below are some triggers commonly used for Projectiles, each paired with a short explanation of its use case:

1. **when this entity touches projectile**  
   - **Use Case**: If you‚Äôre scripting from the viewpoint of a **Unit** or **Wall**, you can detect when a projectile collides with it‚Äîe.g., apply damage or spawn a particle effect.

2. **when a projectile enters this entity‚Äôs sensor**  
   - **Use Case**: For advanced detection. If you have a sensor area that picks up any projectile passing through (like a shield bubble), you can block or redirect it.

3. **when this entity stops touching projectile**  
   - **Use Case**: Some scripts might need to handle a ‚Äúcontinued contact‚Äù scenario (like lingering flames or sticky bombs). Once the projectile is no longer in contact, you can finalize an effect.

4. **when this entity touches wall** (using Projectile Scripts)  
   - **Use Case**: If the projectile hits a wall, you might want to spawn an explosion or destroy it on impact. Perfect for grenades, arrows, or bullets that can‚Äôt pass through solid objects.

5. **when this entity touches unit** (using Projectile Scripts)  
   - **Use Case**: Damage logic‚Äîlike a bullet or arrow dealing hit points to whatever unit it collides with. Alternatively, create a knockback effect or a special status condition (poison, stun, etc.).

## Example: Colliding with Walls or Units

Below is a screenshot showing triggers for a projectile that **explodes** and then **destroys itself** upon hitting either a wall or a unit:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img
    src="imgs/projectile2.PNG"
    alt="Projectile Collides with Wall or Unit"
    style="max-width: 700px; height: auto;"
  />
</div>

### How It Works 

1. **Trigger Condition**  
   - The script runs when the projectile **touches** a wall or a unit.
2. **Explosion Creation**  
   - Upon collision, an **explosion** entity is spawned at the projectile‚Äôs position, simulating a blast effect.
3. **Projectile Removal**  
   - After creating the explosion, the projectile **destroys itself** so it doesn‚Äôt linger in the game world.

This simple logic can be extended to handle different projectile types‚Äîfor example, sticky mines, bouncing grenades, or piercing arrows that continue traveling after a collision.

## Practical Projectile Scenarios

Consider the following applications for your projectile scripts:

1. **Damage & Health**  
   - Reduce a unit‚Äôs health on impact, optionally awarding kill credit if health drops below 0.  
2. **Particles & Visual FX**  
   - Spawn sparks, dust, or a flash of light whenever a projectile strikes an object.  
3. **Physics & Trajectory**  
   - Implement bounce or deflection if the projectile hits a surface at a certain angle.  
4. **Expiration Timers**  
   - If a projectile travels for too long without hitting anything, destroy it to prevent an infinite number of objects in the game.  
5. **Special Abilities**  
   - Poison darts, cluster bombs, or magical orbs that create additional projectiles upon impact.

## Summary

**Projectile Scripts** are your key to **dynamic combat and interactions**. By handling collisions with walls, units, or sensors, you can make your projectiles explode, bounce, or apply special effects to targets. Whether it‚Äôs a simple arrow or a sophisticated guided missile, scripting your projectiles helps ensure each shot feels meaningful and impactful.

### Next Steps

- Try combining these collision triggers with **damage** or **status effects** (e.g., poison, slow, or area-of-effect blasts).  
- Use **tags** or **entity variables** to differentiate projectile types (e.g., ‚ÄúFireArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúIceArrow‚Äù), letting them produce unique effects upon impact.  
- Integrate **network syncing** if you want all players to see the projectile‚Äôs movement and collision outcomes in real time.
