# How to contribute

First, we strongly recommend you to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XRe8T7K) server. This is where you can best communicate with other community members.
We are always looking for more help from the community. PRs are always welcome.


# Documentation Contribution

The best way to contribute in documentation is by loading the documentation on your local machine as instructed [here](https://github.com/moddio/moddio-docs/edit/main/README.md).
With this approach, you can preview your changes locally. 

Once your changes are ready to be submitted, create a Pull Request in the [Moddio Docs Github Repo](https://github.com/moddio/moddio-docs/pulls), and someone from our core team will review.
