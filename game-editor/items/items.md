# Items

Items in the game serve as **interactive objects** that units can hold, use, or equip. They play a crucial role in defining **weapons, consumables, armor, and tools** that enhance gameplay mechanics.

## Item vs. Item Type

There is a distinction between **Item** and **Item Type** that applies to all entities:

- **Item**: An **individual instance** of an object that exists in the game world (e.g., a health potion held by a player).
- **Item Type**: The **template or definition** that specifies the properties of all instances of that item (e.g., the health potion's effects, stack limits, and description).

By defining an **Item Type**, you create a reusable blueprint that dictates how each spawned instance behaves.
