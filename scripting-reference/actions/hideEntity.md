Hides the entity from all other AI and human players and prevents all interactions with it.
That means:
- it can't be seen
- it can't be touched (has no body)
- it's 'every tick' trigger won't execute
- AI players can't target it

To make the entity interactible again, use ["show entity"](https://www.modd.io/docs/functions/showEntity).
